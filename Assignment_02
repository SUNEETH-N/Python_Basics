1.)   What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
ANS)	The two values of boolean data type and is written as :
			 True and False
2.)		What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
ANS)	AND, OR and NOT are the three different types of boolean operators
3.) 	Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
ANS)	i) AND OPERATOR: When both the inputs are True then the output will be true.
			Truth table :
					A		B		      Y=A.B
					0		0			0
					0		1			0
					1		0			0
					1		1			1
	ii) OR OPERATOR: When any one input is True the output will be True.
			Truth table:
					A		B		      Y=A+B
					0		0			0
					0		1			1
					1		0			1
					1		1			1
	iii) NOT OPERATOR: When the input is True then the output will ve False and vice-versa.
			Truth table:
					A	     Y=A^-1
					0		1
					1		0
4.)	What are the values of the following expressions?
ANS)
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)					:			True
not (5 > 4)						:			False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)					:			True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))				:			False
(True and True) and (True == False)			:			False
(not False) or (not True)				:			True

5.)	What are the six comparison operators?
ANS)	<,>,>=,<=,==,!= These are the six comparison operators used in python.
