1.)   What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
ANS)	The two values of boolean data type and is written as :
			 True and False
2.)		What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
ANS)	AND, OR and NOT are the three different types of boolean operators
3.) 	Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
ANS)	i) AND OPERATOR: When both the inputs are True then the output will be true.
			Truth table :
					A		B		      Y=A.B
					0		0			0
					0		1			0
					1		0			0
					1		1			1
	ii) OR OPERATOR: When any one input is True the output will be True.
			Truth table:
					A		B		      Y=A+B
					0		0			0
					0		1			1
					1		0			1
					1		1			1
	iii) NOT OPERATOR: When the input is True then the output will ve False and vice-versa.
			Truth table:
					A	     Y=A^-1
					0		1
					1		0
4.)	What are the values of the following expressions?
ANS)
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)					:			True
not (5 > 4)						:			False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)					:			True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))				:			False
(True and True) and (True == False)			:			False
(not False) or (not True)				:			True

5.)	What are the six comparison operators?
ANS)	<,>,>=,<=,==,!= These are the six comparison operators used in python.
6.) 	How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
ANS)    i) "=" this is used as the assignment operator to assign the value onthe right to the variable on the left.
	eg:	a=10 here a - this is variable 
			  10 - value
	ii) "==" this is used as equal to operator to check the value or variable on the left is equal to the value or variable on the right.
	eg:	
	a=10
	b=20
	if a==b:
		print(a+b)
	else:
	print("the values are not equal")
7.)	Identify the three blocks in this code:
			spam = 0				# value of spam
			if spam == 10:				# Block 1, if it is False it will terminate to the last line, if it is True enters in 
				print('eggs')			# Block 1, if True print 'eggs'
				if spam > 5:			# Block 1, if False terminates and if True enter in to Block 2 
					print('bacon')		# Block 1, if Block 2 is True print "bacon"
				else:				# Block 1, Block 3 is used to print default "ham"
					print('ham')		# Block 1, Block 3 prints "ham"
				print('spam')			# Block 1, print "spam"
			print('spam')				# terminates from the the loop and print "spam"
