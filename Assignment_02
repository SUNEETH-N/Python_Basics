1.)   What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
ANS)	The two values of boolean data type and is written as :
			 True and False
2.)		What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
ANS)	AND, OR and NOT are the three different types of boolean operators
3.) 	Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
ANS)	i) AND OPERATOR: When both the inputs are True then the output will be true.
			Truth table :
					A		B		      Y=A.B
					0		0			0
					0		1			0
					1		0			0
					1		1			1
	ii) OR OPERATOR: When any one input is True the output will be True.
			Truth table:
					A		B		      Y=A+B
					0		0			0
					0		1			1
					1		0			1
					1		1			1
	iii) NOT OPERATOR: When the input is True then the output will ve False and vice-versa.
			Truth table:
					A	     Y=A^-1
					0		1
					1		0
4.)	What are the values of the following expressions?
ANS)
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)					:			True
not (5 > 4)						:			False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)					:			True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))				:			False
(True and True) and (True == False)			:			False
(not False) or (not True)				:			True

5.)	What are the six comparison operators?
ANS)	<,>,>=,<=,==,!= These are the six comparison operators used in python.
6.) 	How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
ANS)    i) "=" this is used as the assignment operator to assign the value onthe right to the variable on the left.
	eg:	a=10 here a - this is variable 
			  10 - value
	ii) "==" this is used as equal to operator to check the value or variable on the left is equal to the value or variable on the right.
	eg:	
	a=10
	b=20
	if a==b:
		print(a+b)
	else:
	print("the values are not equal")
7.)	Identify the three blocks in this code:
			spam = 0				# value of spam
			if spam == 10:				# Block 1, if it is False it will terminate to the last line, if it is True enters in 
				print('eggs')			# Block 1, if True print 'eggs'
				if spam > 5:			# Block 1, if False terminates and if True enter in to Block 2 
					print('bacon')		# Block 1, if Block 2 is True print "bacon"
				else:				# Block 1, Block 3 is used to print default "ham"
					print('ham')		# Block 1, Block 3 prints "ham"
				print('spam')			# Block 1, print "spam"
			print('spam')				# terminates from the the loop and print "spam"
		Hence there are three blocks in this code.
8.) 	Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
ANS)	spam = n
	if spam == 1:
	    print("Hello")
	elif spam == 2:
	    print("Howdy")
	else:
	    print("Greetings!")

		here n = 1,2,3,......
9.)	If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
ANS)	We can make use of control statement to terminatee or continue the loop in those kind of programs to still execute the program.
	the control statements are "break" and "continue"
10.) 	How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
ANS)	i) Break - break is used to terminate from the loop as soon as the compiler execute break keyword and it is unecessary what ever the code may be after break keyword
	eg:
		a=10
		while a>9:
			print("yes the value is greater than 9")
			break
			if a>=5:
				print("the value is greater than 5")
		
	ii) Continue - as soon as the compiler executes the keyword continue it will go on continuing the in the same loop without terminating from the loop and 
		execute all the other lines after the continue statement.
		
	eg:
		a=1
		while a<10:
    			if a==4:
       				a=a+1
        			continue
    			else:
       				print(a)
        			a=a+1
11.) 	In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
ANS)	range()	is the function used to get the series of integers in a sequence given.
	range(10) 	-  This has only stop point is mentioned in the series of number from 0 to 10
	range(0,10)	-  This has both start as well as stop point mentioned in the statement as the series of number from 0 to 10
	range(0,10,1)	-  This has all the i,e. start,stop and step mentioned in the statement as the series of number from 0 to 10 in a step size of 1
12.) Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
ANS)	Printing 1 to 10 using for loop
	i)	for i in range(1,11):
    			print(i)
	Printing 1 to 10 using while loop
    	ii)	a=1
		while a in range(1,11):
			print(a)
			a=a+1
13.) If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
ANS)		import spam
		spam.bacon()
	The function can be called by "spam.bacon()"
